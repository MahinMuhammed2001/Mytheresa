Using the Scrapy framework, I conducted a data extraction from the Mytheresa website. The process involved creating a Scrapy spider to navigate the site, identify product listings, and extract key information such as product names, prices, descriptions, and availability. The spider utilized XPath selectors to pinpoint relevant HTML elements, ensuring precise and efficient data collection. The extracted data was then structured and stored in a CSV file, enabling further analysis and insights into the product offerings on Mytheresa. This approach demonstrates the powerful capabilities of Scrapy in web scraping and data mining tasks.
